WHAT:
=====

Tool to find identical sets of files based on their hashes.

Name: ua (from Hungarian UgyanAz).

LICENSE:
=======

Mozilla  Public  License, http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/
Also see the copytight notes in the source files.

BUILD:
======

This is what the supplied Makefile does.

Simply:

  $ g++ -o ua -O3 -I. ua.cc filei.cc -lcrypto 

or

  $ g++ -o ua -O3 -I. -D__NOHASH ua.cc filei.cc -lcrypto 


The tool uses openssl's md5 (libcrypto). The tool also uses the POSIX 
getopt lib.

The tool may use sorted (tree based) or hashed data structures. By default,
hashed ones preferred. This can be overridden by specifying __NOHASH.
Also it can be passed to make as

  $ make DEFINES="-D__NOHASH"


INSTALL:
========

  $ make
  $ sudo make install

  If you want libraries as well,

  $ make all
  $ sudo make install

  Or if you do not like /usr/local as the location

  $ sudo make install PREFIX=/opt

  To clean up,

  $ make clean

  To uninstall,

  $ make uninstall

  The provided Makefile understands the following variables:

  PREFIX:   root of install (default /usr/local)
  CXX:      C++ compiler (default g++)
  CLFAGS:   compiler flags (default -O3 -Wall)
  LDFLAGS:  linker flags (default -lcrypto)
  DEFINES:  preprocessor definitions (default "")


FILES:
======

  filei.h:  header with class and function definitions, can be used
            in other tools

  filei.cc: implementation of stuff defined in filei.h, can be included
            in both static and dynamic libraries

  ua.cc:    main


DOCUMENTATION:
==============

  filei.h extensively documents the interface. Sparse comments in the cc
  files help in understanding the code.


USAGE:
======

   After install, see the man page, 

   $ man ua

   Or read the online help

   $ ua -vh
